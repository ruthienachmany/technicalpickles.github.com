title: "Some jeweler resources you probably didn't know about"
---

If you've been using [jeweler](http://technicalpickles) for awhile or are just starting out, there are a few resources you should be aware of. I admit, maybe I've been a little undervocal about their existence. Anyways, here they are:

 * The [README](http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/blob/master/README.markdown)
 * The [Wiki](http://wiki.github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler)
 * The [Issue Tracker](http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/issues)
 * The [IRC Channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/jeweler) (#jeweler on irc.freenode.net)
 * The [Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/jeweler-rb)
 * [Projects using jeweler](http://wiki.github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/projects-using-jeweler)
 * The [RDoc](irc://irc.freenode.net/jeweler)
 * The [Source](github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler)

 
IF you have questions or whatnot, I'd suggest trying these resources out in that order.

For the IRC channel, I'll try to be available when I can. If a particular question/issue might take more than a bit to deal with, there's a good chance I'll direct you to post an ticket on the [Issue Tracker](http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/issues) or to post on the [Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/jeweler-rb) for a less synchronous response.

As for the [Issue Tracker](http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/issues) and [Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/jeweler-rb), I'll try to respond as a quickly as is reasonable with stuff like 'Hmm, yes, this is definitely a bug' or 'Could you elaborate a bit more?' or 'Ah, you probably want to take a look at this documentation' or 'Oh, that works, it's just not documented well yet'.

Also, I'd like to note that sending email or GitHub messages directly to me is probably not the way to work things out. I only say this because they tend to get lost in my inbox, and when I go to work on jeweler, the places I check are almost always going to be the [Issue Tracker](http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/issues) and [Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/jeweler-rb). So, don't be offended if I end up forwarding your questions to the mailing list and answer them there. I'm doing this mostly for public archival and accountability.

I guess that's it. Open the flood gates, and I'll see how long I can manage this...
