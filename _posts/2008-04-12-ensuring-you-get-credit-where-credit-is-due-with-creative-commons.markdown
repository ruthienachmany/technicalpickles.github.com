So one day I was bored, and decided to some self googling. After writing my [previous post on Git on Gentoo](/posts/gitosis-on-gentoo), I decided poking searching for 'nichoj git'.

Imagine my surprise when I saw it [reproduced](http://gentoo-wiki.com/Gitosis) on the  [unofficial Gentoo wiki](http://gentoo-wiki.com). Sure, I was cited, but there wasn't a link back to the origin source.

Being a wiki, I was just able to just include the link. I got to thinking, and realized I didn't really have anyway to safeguard against this kind of thing.

Being the open source lover that I am, I know there are ways to do this by appropriately licensing your code. (Here's a decent resource selecting one: [part 1](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Burnette/?p=130), [part 2](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Burnette/?p=131))

I was only vaguely aware of the [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/), so I figured it was past time to read up on it.

All my needs really are:

 * I want to be attributed if you use my stuff
 * I don't want you making money off my stuff without my permission
 
The Creative Commons website actually has some [tools for figuring out what license you should use](http://creativecommons.org/license/).

According to this, I should be using:

 * [Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/)
 
You can get a snippet to include the license on the page so people can know what is what. I opted to use a slightly altered version in my footer, to better fit in with the style of my site.

And with that, my content is licensed.
