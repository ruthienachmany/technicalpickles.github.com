Blog posts are hard. Tweets are easy. Tumblr is somewhere in between.

I've began a new tumblr, "Technical Pickle Jar":http://technicalpicklejar.tumblr.com/. The general intent is that it captures my current softwarey thoughts, that haven't quite matured to full blog post status.

So, if you're dying to know what's on my mind, "check it out":http://technicalpicklejar.tumblr.com/
