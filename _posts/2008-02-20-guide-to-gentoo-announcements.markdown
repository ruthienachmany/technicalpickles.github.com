You've probably noticed that there have been a lot more announcements lately if you subscribe to [gentoo.org](gentoo.org)'s or [planet.gentoo.org](planet.gentoo.org)'s feed. You can largely thank [Donnie](http://spyderous.livejournal.com/) for this improvement.

Announcements now carry a 'Discuss this!' link. Announcements have historically been one-way communications, of us pushing information to you. These links will hopefully encourage communication in both directions.

We have also been more mindful of how the announcements are written and presented.

 * Tables and lists
 * Lots of links
 * Emphasize important text with bold
 
This only touches some of the things we have been thinking about when posting.

In the name of openness, I started a [announcement guide](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/pr/docs/announcement-guide.xml). This covers in depth how an announcement is made, and consideration that should be taken when writing it. It's still in draft, but it's a decent starting point.
