It's been way to quiet around here. I personally blame [Halo 3](http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/data/926632.html)... and before that, [Metroid Prime 3: Corruption](http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/wii/data/928517.html).

I've actually beaten both, so theoretically should be free of their shackles... except for the temptations of beating them on a higher difficulties and playing multiplayer.

Another hurdle is that my primary Gentoo box is out of commission for now. I noticed randomly that the power supply's fan wasn't actually running. Bad news bear.

It should be simple enough to fix, ie replace the fan, but things like these usually.

That being said, there's nothing wrong with my laptop or work machine, so I hope to post something more significant soon.
