I don't think many people are aware of it, but [Gentoo Prefix](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/index.xml) is a valid alternative to [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) and [Fink](http://www.finkproject.org/) for installing unix-y type software on Mac OS X.

Personally, I just use it to install all those command line tools and utilities I miss from Linux.

Here's my development-centric laundry list of things I've used it to install:

  * version control  
    * cvs
    * darcs
    * git
  * Java stuff (yep, it supports Java using Apple's SDK)
    * ant
    * maven
  * Others
    * nmap
    * keychain

So remember kiddies, [Gentoo works on Mac OS X too](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/bootstrap-macos.xml)!
