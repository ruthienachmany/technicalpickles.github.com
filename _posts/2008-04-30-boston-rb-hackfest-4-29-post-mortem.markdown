So, we were just kidding about working on the recommendable plugin. We actually worked on the bostonrb.org website some more.

The crew tonight was:

 * [Dan Croak](http://dancroak.com)
 * Wyatt Greene
 * Brian Underwood
 * [Josh Nichols](http://technicalpickles.com)
 * Steve Morss

The significant things we worked on were:

 * Projects have descriptions now
 * Events now have a location
 * Reorganized events page
  * left side has all upcoming events
  * center has next event with google map
  * right side has nothing now, but we're thinking to put a calendar type view

Some articles, resources, that came up while hacking away:
