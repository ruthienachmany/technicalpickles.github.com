			<p>Just to keep people updated about how the new Java stuff is going... it's going pretty good :-D</p>

<p>A lot of smaller kinks have been worked out, better documentation, more useful error / warnings, and such forth. All in all, there has been a lot of good input and feedback.Most of the issues users have been running into is not having everything unmasked and keyworded properly. With  unmasking,the former will no longer be an issue.</p>

<p>So, I hope to go forward with unmasking over the long (read: 4 1/2 days) weekend. At that point, we'll begin switching packages over to using the new eclasses, doing version bumps, bug squashing, and all that jive.</p>
