If it has been quiet around this blog, it is because of this: [SNIF Tag](http://sniftag.com) has launched!

'What does that have to do with [technicalpickles](/)?', one might ask. Allow me to tell you: I started working there back in August, and have been working like mad to get ready for this big launch. It is also worth noting that [SNIF](http://sniftag.com) is my first professional ruby job, which might surprise some of our kind readers.

So what is this SNIF Tag thing? Simply put, it is an intelligent dog tag. You attach it to your dog's collar, where it can detect encounters with other SNIF-enabled pups, and monitor your dog's physical activity. We then have a [website](http://sniftag.com) where you can see who your dog is encountering, as well as monitor your dog's activity in real time as well as look at historical data.

We've already been featured on [engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2008/11/10/snif-tags-go-commercial-promise-to-monitor-your-dogs-activity/) and [gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/5082676/snif-tag-social-networking-lets-your-dog-get-in-on-the-action), and this is only the beginning.
