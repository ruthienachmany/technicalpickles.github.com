My bad, [Planet Gentoo](http://planet.gentoo.org).

[A fellow Josh](planet.gentoo.org/developers/nightmorph) pointed out that my feed is screwing things up pretty bad. Two things:

 * Really old posts I imported from my Gentoo blog are showing up
 * The page is VERRRRRRRY wide for some reason
 
I fixed the first one. The reason was because Planet was pointing at my [gentoo tag](http://technicalpickles.com/posts/tags/gentoo)... but my tag stuff was a little buggy. Instead of showing only published items, in order of publication date, it was showing everything in order of creation. This is fixed now.

No clue about the second problem. Josh thought it might have to do with my code snippets, but it's kind of hard to tell.
