This past weekend I attended [BarCampBoston3](http://2008.barcampboston.org/), my first unconference ever. Overall, I'd saw it was an amazing experience.

If you're not familiar with BarCamp, and the whole unconference thing, here are some quick links that might give you a better idea:

 * [What is BarCamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp)
 * [What to expect](http://barcamp.org/WhatToExpect)
 * [The rules of BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/TheRulesOfBarCamp)

I gave 2 talk sessions and 2 discussion sessions over the course of the weekend. I hope to post the presentation/notes from the talks as I recover and find time this week:

 * git as a replacement for subversion... and more!
 * Boston Ruby birds of a feather
 * Testing, quality control, and other ways to preserve your sanity
 * Who is the final cylon model?

Just a few quick notes and thoughts, as a presenter and attendee

### For presenters

 * Get to your room early, so you don't fumble for 5 minutes setting things up
 * Don't forget appropriate dongles if you happen to be cursed by Apple's mini-DVI
 * 30-minute sessions go real quick
 * If running your laptop off battery, set to optimal performance to avoid display turning off
 * Turn off notifications, like growl

### For attendees

 * Don't use your first attendance to get to know how these work. Jump on it! Give a talk.
 * You probably have something interesting to give a talk on. You just don't realize it.
 * Don't be shy. If all else fails, you could get [this shirt](http://www.glarkware.com/productcart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=3&idproduct=2430)
 * Bring business cards
