[Merb](http://www.merbivore.com/) has been getting a good amount of attention lately as an alternative to rails. I've been playing with it a little since I've been playing around with [blerb](http://42squared.com/2007/12/2/blerb).

One thing I've discovered is that some things are a bit underdocumented, both in terms of rdoc and more generalized documentation.

As a result of this, I've decided to start a series of posts 'Meet merb', where I'll talk about some of the bits and pieces I've learned along the way.
