After attending a few sessions that talked about aspect oriented programming at [NFJS](/blog/2007/9/17/nfjs-summary-and-thoughts-on-the-new-england-software-symposium.html) this past weekend, I've been itching for a place to use it in our project. We're going to need to do some domain-level auditing at some point, so this seems like an appropriate place to do it.

Here's some AOP (more specifically [AspectJ](http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/)) resources for you:

 * [Getting Started With AspectJ](http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/progguide/starting.html)
 * [The AspectJ Programming Guide](http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/progguide/index.html)
 * [AspectJ 5 Development Kit Developer's Notebook](http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/adk15notebook/index.html)
 * [Spring Framework Reference: Aspect Oriented Programming with Spring](http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/aop.html)
