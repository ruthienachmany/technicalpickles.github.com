Today, it was my first time being involved with the interview process. Being the go-getter that I am, I of course tried to do a bit of research on the interwebs. Here is what I found:

  * [Does specific technology knowledge matter when recruiting?](http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/08/buzzword-driven-recruiting) My sources say no.
  * [A Guide to Hiring Programmers: The High Cost of Low Quality](http://blog.revsys.com/2007/08/a-guide-to-hiri.html) You know what they say, 5 rock star programmers can outperform a hundred medicore ones. So how do you get those 5 top programmers?
  * [Effective Technology Teams: Rule #1, No Chumps](http://www.innovationontherun.com/effective-technology-teams-rule-1-no-chumps/) Covers some heurestics and other techniques for shifting through the medicore developers.
  * [The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing (version 3.0)](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html) More of the same.
