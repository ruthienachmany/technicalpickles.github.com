This past [Boston Ruby Group](http://bostonrb.org/events/55) meeting I gave a presentation entitled "Rake: The Familiar Stranger". You are in luck, because I started recording our meetings, with a little help from a shiny new [Flip Video Mino HD](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=4&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theflip.com%2Fproducts_flip_mino.shtml&ei=R1JDSZnqEaHYeffPxOgI&usg=AFQjCNGGUNDkHjit5iP8Bc33p0gqYwsyEA&sig2=HAUwNPVSndWKlRb6ta5qzg) and a tripod. 

You can find the [video up on vimeo](http://vimeo.com/2496890) and the [slides up on slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/technicalpickles/rake-the-familiar-stranger-presentation).

Oh, and if you like what you see, don't be afraid to recommend me on [Working With Rails](http://www.workingwithrails.com/recommendation/new/person/10749-josh-nichols) :)
