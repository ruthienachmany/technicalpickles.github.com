I've been using [git](http://git.or.cz/) a lot more since my [last set of git links](/posts/git-links-for-2007-01-05).


 * [Cheat sheet](http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/git/) from [Err the Blog](http://errtheblog.com).
 * [Another cheat-sheet type deal](http://wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git_quickstart). Includes lots of useful alias and other configs.
 * [Dealing with branches, remotes, and merging](http://blog.nanorails.com/articles/2008/2/7/git-branches-merges-and-remotes)
 * [For when you have to change where your 'origin' repo lives](http://github.com/guides/changing-your-origin)

There are hosting options available, even if you don't want to [setup something up yourself](/posts/gitosis-on-gentoo). I've only used GitHub myself, so I can't speak for the others

 * [GitHub](http://github.com/): Currently in invite-beta mode (no, I don't have any more invites)
 * [repo.or.cz](http://repo.or.cz/): provides public hosting
 * [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org/): targets open source projects
