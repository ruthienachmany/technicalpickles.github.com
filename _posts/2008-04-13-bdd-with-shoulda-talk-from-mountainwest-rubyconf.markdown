I've been using [Shoulda](http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda) on a few projects recently, and have done a [few](/posts/shoulda-and-assert-2-0-make-swell-bedfellows) [posts](/posts/shoulda-macros-allows-you-to-embrace-your-inner-slacker) on it as well.

Last week, I came across this [talk](http://mtnwestrubyconf2008.confreaks.com/12saleh.html) by [Tammer Saleh](http://tammersaleh.com/) by way of [
GIANT ROBOTS SMASHING INTO OTHER GIANT ROBOTS
](http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2008/4/7/conference-videos).

Tammer is the author of Shoulda, and hearing him talk about it definitely gave me some insight into Shoulda and how to use it.
