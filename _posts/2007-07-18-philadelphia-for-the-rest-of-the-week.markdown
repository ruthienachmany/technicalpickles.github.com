I'm leaving tomorrow morning (a short five hours away...) for Philadelphia for a wedding of two very awesome people (Congratulations Jim & Chelsea!).

If I'm lucky, I might find time in trillion hours of riding that will be happening to write up a few posts, so I'll have material for the upcoming week.
