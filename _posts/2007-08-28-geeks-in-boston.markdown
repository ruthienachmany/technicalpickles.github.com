Shortly after attending [DevHouse earlier this summer](/blog/permalink/devhouseboston.html), I managed to come across [geeksinboston](http://geeksinboston.com), a blog dedicated towards keeping tabs on the various tech events and meetings in the area.

Regretfully it has been updated much recently. I feel like I have a decent pulse on the events going on, so I contacted the maintainer, [Shimon Rura](http://rura.org/shimon/), about how I could help out. He agreed to let me [join as a co-blogger](http://geeksinboston.com/2007/08/24/first-post/)!

So if you happen to be in the Boston area, and looking to find out more about what's going on for technology events, [check it out](http://geeksinboston.com).
