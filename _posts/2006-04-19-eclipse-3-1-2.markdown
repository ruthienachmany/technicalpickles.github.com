So, I've recently joined the dev-tools team in order to help maintain dev-util/eclipse-sdk. The ebuilds themselves haven't been touched much lately, aside from the occasional version bumps, and so have been in need of a little love.

I've just added 3.1.2 to the tree recently. In terms of upstream changes since 3.1.1, there isn't too much to write home about. In terms of the ebuilds, I've manage clean up a number of things that would make mere mortals tremble. This isn't to say the ebuilds are quite ideal yet, but it is certainly a step in the right direction.

In the coming weeks, I hope to continue sanitizing the Eclipse ebuilds, in addition to getting ready for the 3.2 release, which just entered release candidate last week.
