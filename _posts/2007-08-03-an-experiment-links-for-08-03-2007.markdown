I've decided to try a daily (or near daily) roundup of links I've come across. The intent, for now, is to fill in gaps between days when I don't get to write up a real post.

  * [Recapping UI Architectural Patterns](http://www.continuousthinking.com/2007/3/4/recapping-ui-architectural-patterns) Model View Controller is a common pattern you see in Java web frameworks. Less common is Model View Presenter, although I hear it is used in the C# world. It's an informative read to compare the two, as well as some derivatives thereof.
  * [Opportunity Overload](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/management/opportunity-overload.html) These past few months, I've found myself reading a lot more blogs outside of my typical technical fare. Finances, 'life hacking', productivity, and so on. This post struck a chord with me, and it has me re-evaluating what I'm trying to achieve by being informed on these topics.
  * [Why Ruby On Rails Succeeded](http://www.cio.com/article/125851/Why_Ruby_on_Rails_Succeeded) Rails really seems to be picking up steam nowadays. I have found myself particularly enamored with it. This post is a nice retrospective about how it got to where it is.

This format, of course, is experimental. Feel free to leave feedback on the good and the bad.
